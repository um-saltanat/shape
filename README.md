# Shape
A program that will create a geometric shape and get its area and perimeter. Program will repeat the process until the user chooses to exit the program.
Available geometric shapes:
- rectangle
- circle
- triangle
- square

### Shape
- an abstract class that contains two abctract methods: getArea(), getPerimeter().
### Rectangle
- a class that extends abstract class Shape
- has such instance variables as : width, height
### Circle 
- a class that extends abstract class Shape
- has such instance variables as : radius
### Triangle
- a class that extends abstract class Shape
- has such instance variables as : side1, side2, side3
### Square
- a class that extends classs Rectangle
- has such instance variables as : length (represents the length of all sides)
